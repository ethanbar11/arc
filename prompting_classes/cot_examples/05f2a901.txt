By looking at the first training example I'm inferring that:
1. All the {0} values represent empty cells.
2. All the {2} values represent cells of the first object.
3. All the {8} values represent cells of the second object.
5. The first object (represented by the {8} values) is horizontally above the second object, and somewhat in the same
    vertical location.
6. The input and output grids are two-dimensional and stays the same size.
7. The transformation applied is as follows:
    - The second object (represented by the {2} values) stays in the same location
    - The first object (represented by the {8} values) is moved vertically to be on top of the second object,
    with the same horizontal location.

By looking at the second training example I'm inferring that:
1. All the {0} values represent empty cells.
2. All the {2} values represent cells of the first object.
3. All the {8} values represent cells of the second object.
5. The first object (represented by the {8} values) is vertically to the left of the second object, and somewhat in the same
    horizontal location.
6. The input and output grids are two-dimensional and stays the same size.
7. The transformation applied is as follows:
    - The second object (represented by the {2} values) stays in the same location
    - The first object (represented by the {8} values) is moved vertically to be adjacent to the second object,
    on the left of it, with the same horizontal location.

By looking at the third training example I'm inferring that:
1. All the {0} values represent empty cells.
2. All the {2} values represent cells of the first object.
3. All the {8} values represent cells of the second object.
5. The first object (represented by the {8} values) is horizontally to above of the second object, and somewhat in the same
    vertical location.
6. The input and output grids are two-dimensional and stays the same size.
7. The transformation applied is as follows:
    - The second object (represented by the {2} values) stays in the same location
    - The first object (represented by the {8} values) is moved horizontally to be adjacent to the second object,
    below it, with the same vertical location.

Thus, for the test input:
1. All the {0} values represent empty cells.
2. All the {2} values represent cells of the first object.
3. All the {8} values represent cells of the second object.
5. The first object (represented by the {8} values) is vertically to the right of the second object, and somewhat in the same
    horizontal location.
6. The input and output grids are two-dimensional and stays the same size.
7. The transformation applied is as follows:
    - The second object (represented by the {2} values) stays in the same location
    - The first object (represented by the {8} values) is moved vertically to be adjacent to the second object,
    on the right of it, with the same horizontal location.

And thus the output matrix is:
{out}
