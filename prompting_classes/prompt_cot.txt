Question: The following riddles are part of a competition to test the ability of AI to solve riddles and show reasoning capabilities.
Each riddle is composed of train examples, each containing an input matrix and an output matrix, connected by a transformation.
Notice that the same transformation is applied to the input matrix for all examples, and the output matrix is the result of the transformation.
Your job is to deduct the transformation and apply it to the test matrix.
Perform the following riddle while explaining it step by step.
First, explain the logic behind each example while trying to deduct the transformation for all of them, and only then apply the same transformation to the test one.
